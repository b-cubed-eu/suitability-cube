# Suitability Cube 
The Suitability Cube (SC) is a reproducible, multidimensional structure designed to critically evaluate the outcomes of species distribution models (SDMs) in relation to the environmental data on which they are built. By organizing information across space, time, and taxa, the SC links species occurrence records with environmental predictors within a unified analytical framework, allowing a more transparent assessment of habitat suitability patterns and model reliability.
